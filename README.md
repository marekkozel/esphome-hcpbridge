This is a esphome-based adaption of the HCPBridge. Credits for the initial development of the HCPBridge go to [Gifford47](https://github.com/Gifford47/HCPBridgeMqtt), [hkiam](https://github.com/hkiam/HCPBridge) and all the other guys contributed.

## Usage

### Example esphome configuration

```YAML
esphome:
  name: hcpbridge
  libraries:
    - emelianov/modbus-esp8266 # Required for communication with the modbus
  platformio_options:
    board_build.f_cpu: 240000000L
    board_build.flash_mode: qio
    monitor_speed: 9600
    monitor_filters: esp32_exception_decoder
    lib_ldf_mode: deep+
    # board_build.f_flash: 40000000L

external_components:
    source: github://mapero/esphome-hcpbridge
    refresh: 0s # Ensure you always get the latest version

esp32:
  board: adafruit_feather_esp32s3
  framework:
    type: arduino

hcpbridge:
  is_connected: # Sensor to display the connection status to the motor
    name: "HCPBridge Connected"

cover:
  - platform: hcpbridge
    name: Garage Door

switch:
  - platform: hcpbridge
    name: Garage Light

# API to communicate with home assistant
api:
  encryption:
    key: !secret api_key

# Enable OTA updates
ota:
  safe_mode: true
```

### Home Assistant

![Home Assistant Device Overview](docs/device_overview.png)

### Cover

The component provides a cover component to control the garage door.

### Switch

The component provides a switch component to turn the light off and on.

### Services

Additionally, when using the cover component, you can use the following services:

- `esphome.hcpbridge_go_to_close`: To close the garage door
- `esphome.hcpbridge_go_to_half`: To move the garage door to half position
- `esphome.hcpbridge_go_to_vent`: To move the garage door to the vent position
- `esphome.hcpbridge_go_to_open`: To open the garage door

# Project

- HCPBridge from `Tysonpower` on an `Hörmann Promatic 4`

# ToDo

- [x] Initial working version
- [ ] Use esphome modbus component instead of own code
- [ ] Map additional functions to esphome
- [ ] Use callbacks instead of pollingComponent
- [x] Expert options for the HCPBridge component (GPIOs ...)
